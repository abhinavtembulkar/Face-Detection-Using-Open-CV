# Face-Detection-Using-Open-CV
This is a simple demonstration of face detection using the OpenCV library in python (in a few lines of code). Face detection using Haar cascades is a machine learning based approach where a cascade function is trained with a set of input data. OpenCV already contains many pre-trained classifiers for face, eyes, smiles, etc.. We will be using the face classifier.
